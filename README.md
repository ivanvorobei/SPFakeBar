I have a store where I sell applications and modules for Xcode projects. You can find source codes of applications or custom animations / UI. I regularly update the code.

## Requirements
Swift 4.2. Ready for use on iOS 10+

## Integration
Put `Source/SPFakeBar` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.

Or via CocoaPods:
```ruby
pod 'SPFakeBar'
```

## How to use

You may want to add a navigation bar to your modal controller. Since it became impossible to change or customize the native controller in swift 4 (I couldn’t even find a way to change the height of the bar), I had to recreate navigation bar from the ground up. Visually it looks real, but it doesn’t execute the necessary functions:

```swift
import UIKit

class ModalController: UIViewController {
    
    let navBar = SPFakeBarView(style: .stork)
        
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.white

        self.navBar.titleLabel.text = "Title"
        self.navBar.leftButton.setTitle("Cancel", for: .normal)
        self.navBar.leftButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(self.dismissAction), for: .touchUpInside)

        self.view.addSubview(self.navBar)
    }
}
```

You only need to add a navigation bar to the main view, it will automatically layout. Use style `.stork` in init of `SPFakeBarView`. Here is visual preview with Navigation Bar and without it:

## My projects

Here I would like to offer you my other projects.

### SPStorkController
I created [SPStorkController](https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SPStorkController). It is a modal controller like in Mail or Apple Music application. Similar animation and transition. You can see an example of using controller in app [in AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1446635818).

### SPPermission
Project [SPPermission](https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SPPermission) for managing permissions with customizable visual effects. Beautiful dialog increases the chance of approval (which is important when we request notification). Simple control of this module saves you hours of development. You can start using project with just two lines of code and easy customization!
