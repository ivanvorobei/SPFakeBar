# SPFakeBar

Very similar to original Navigation Bar. Full customisable - height, buttons and many other. Used it as simple view. Not support transition and native nack button. You can download example [Debts - Spending tracker](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1446635818) or [Code - Learn Swift & Design](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1453325619) apps from AppStore. It apps used `SPFakeBar`. If you like the project, do not forget to **put star ★**

## Requirements

Swift 4.2 & **5.0**. Ready for use on iOS 10+

## Installation

### CocoaPods:

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `SPFakeBar` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SPFakeBar'
```

## Usage

You may want to add a navigation bar to your modal controller. Since it became impossible to change or customize the native controller in swift 4 (I couldn’t even find a way to change the height of the bar), I had to recreate navigation bar from the ground up. Visually it looks real, but it doesn’t execute the necessary functions:

```swift
import UIKit
import SPFakeBar

class ModalController: UIViewController {
    
    let navBar = SPFakeBarView(style: .stork)
        
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.white

        self.navBar.titleLabel.text = "Title"
        self.navBar.leftButton.setTitle("Cancel", for: .normal)
        self.navBar.leftButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(self.dismissAction), for: .touchUpInside)

        self.view.addSubview(self.navBar)
    }
}
```

You only need to add a navigation bar to the main view, it will automatically layout. Use style `.stork` in init of `SPFakeBarView`. Here is visual preview with Navigation Bar and without it:

## My projects

### SPAlert

Native popup [SPAlert](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPAlert) is **similar to Apple Music or Feedback in AppStore** app. Support animations. I tried to repeat Apple alert as much as possible.
